After the Bell

A 3D Horror / Escape Game Developed in Unreal Engine 5

About the Game

The player wakes up alone in a locked laboratory, with no sign of life around and only
darkness ahead. To escape, the player must find a key and enter the hallway, where an
alien creature roams the area. Its distant voice can be heard at all times, creating
constant tension. When the creature spots the player, a distinct sound cue plays before
it begins chasing them.
Throughout the school, classrooms contain notes left behind by an unknown
individual. These notes include important internet security facts that will later help the
player escape. Remembering this information is essential for survival.
Upon reaching the final door, the player encounters a system displaying four questions
based on the clues discovered earlier. All four questions must be answered before the
system responds. If even one answer is incorrect, the system locks without indicating
which response was wrong, forcing the player to restart the entire set of questions - all
while the creature moves closer.
Answer everything correctly to escape the grasp of the alien… or remain trapped with
it forever.

Project Goal
The goal of this project is to:
-> Design and implement an interactive 3D game
-> Apply core game mechanics such as movement, interaction, and collision
detection
-> Use Unreal Engine 5 features such as blueprints, lighting, and audio systems
-> Learn internet security facts as part of the escape

Technologies Used
-> Unreal Engine 5.6
-> Blueprint Visual Scripting
-> 3D assets and sound effects

How to Play:

1. Controls:
    - W, A, S, D - Move
    - Space - Jump
    - Mouse - Look around
    - E - Interact
    - F - Pick up Item
    - Esc - Pause menu
    - Shift + Move - Run (consumes stamina)

2. Objective:
-> The player must correctly answer all four questions displayed at the main entrance in
order to complete the game.
-> Important letters are scattered throughout the school in random locations. These
contain essential internet security facts directly related to the final questions. Players
must explore carefully, collect information, and remember key details to successfully
escape.
